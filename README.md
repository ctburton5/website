Simple to-do list application to practice php and SQL. User is able to add a task to the list and it is inserted into a database. Database updates completed tasks as the user selects the checkbox.

Added sign-in capability. Many users will be able sign in and manage their own to-do list. Once a user is registered, they are added to the database with a hashed password, then tasks are added to another table according to the current users id so only tasks submitted by that user are displayed to them.
